        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Cody Michaud and I was born and raised in the Snohomish area. Currently, I live with my
            girlfriend and our dog in Cheney, Washington. About a year ago, I graduated from a local Community
            College
            with an Associate's Degree in Heavy Equipment and Diesel repair. I worked in that industry for about
            three
            years before I got laid off due to Covid. I realized I wanted to change my career path, as I was seeing
            how
            much I was destroying my body being in the field I was. I've always been interested in coding and
            website
            development, which is why I decided to go back to school to pursue this. Some of my hobbies include
            working
            on my car, spending time with my family, and traveling. My goals after this program are to work in the
            industry for a few yeras as a website developer, maybe even open up my own business and focus on
            maintaining
            smaller businesses websites and shops. I would also love to specialize in Shopify and ShipStation as
            well to
            broaden my knowledge. </p>
